A simple game where you run around catching the falling fruits.
I wanted to learn how to do Sprite Animations in JavaFX and that is the reason I made this project.

# How to play
To play this simply download the source code, and open your favourite IDE. However, make sure you have everything you need installed,
for this project you will need Maven and a Java compiler.
